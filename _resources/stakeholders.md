# Stakeholder Overview

### Quality Improvement Managers – Quality Improvement Officers – Education Support Officers 

Individuals within the quality improvement team are based centrally and will work on authority wide strategic areas, such as literacy development, health & wellbeing, early years etc. Colleagues, specifically quality improvement officers, may also be attached to specific associated school groups. They might support these specific schools by reviewing their attainment data and undertaking internal quality improvement visits. 

### Educational Psychologists 

This group of professionals’ works across the authority and contributes to strategic areas, but there is a considerable focus on additional support for learning. They undertake work directly with children, young people and families around additional support needs and will consult and advise schools on how they can meet these needs. The means in which educational psychologists can contribute to schools meeting the needs of children and young people can be done targeted, at an individual or group level. Or systemically – at a whole school level or indeed a local authority level. 

### School Leaders  

Head teachers and depute head teachers are responsible for the overall operations of the school, including the health, safety and educational attainment of children and young people. They manage staff and will often lead professional learning activities in accordance with the school improvement plan and priorities which schools are required to complete. Leaders will use data and consult with the community, including partners, to construct the school improvement plan.  

### Attainment Advisors 

Attainment advisors are members of staff from Education Scotland – a branch of the Scottish Government. They have the specifically role within the Scottish Attainment Challenge and work with schools who are enrolled within this programme. That is, schools who have a high roll of pupils living in Scotland’s most deprived programmes. Advisors work with these schools to review data and provide additionality in the form of interventions and come from a variety of backgrounds. They also take part in local authority developments as required.
