> How do we use novel data sets and techniques to effectively understand the impact of child poverty on education within urban and rural contexts?

## Outputs

You can follow the key outputs from the project [here](https://noral.netlify.app/).

## Background

The Northern Alliance of Scotland is a regional improvement collaborative, spanning across and supporting 8 local authorities and their associated school settings to improve education and reduce the poverty related attainment gap. Within these settings, children, young people and their families live across a diverse range of urban and rural settlements.

The aim of this collaboration is to determine what data sources and analytical techniques best reflect the challenges of child poverty, and subsequently provide a means to assess the poverty related attainment gap as a result – which will further allow individual school settings, local authorities and other bodies to plan targeted interventions to reduce it.

## Partners

### CivicDataLab

CivicDataLab ([CDL](https://civicdatalab.in/)) works with the goal to use data, tech, design and social science to strengthen the course of civic engagements in India. We work to harness the potential of open-source movement toggit enable citizens to engage better with public reforms. We aim to grow data and tech literacy of governments, nonprofits, think-tanks, media houses, universities etc to enable data-driven decision making at scale.

### Data for Children Collaborative

[The Data for Children Collaborative with UNICEF](https://www.dataforchildrencollaborative.com/) is a unique partnership between UNICEF, The Scottish Government and the University of Edinburgh, hosted by The Edinburgh Futures Institute.

In today’s fast-paced technological landscape, where data is a driving force and evidence is vital to decision making, we want to use data to produce real-world impacts that help the world’s children. Our goal is to leverage the appropriate data and expertise from our community in order to address existing problems for children using innovative data science techniques.
