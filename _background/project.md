## The Project

The aim of this collaboration is to determine what data sources and techniques best reflect the challenges of child poverty, and subsequently provide a means to assess the poverty related attainment gap as a result â€“ which will further allow individual school settings, local authorities and other bodies to plan targeted interventions to reduce it.

Developed through our [Impact Collaborations process](https://www.dataforchildrencollaborative.com/impact-collaborations-1), this project has brought together academic expertise from the Fraser of Allander Institute at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/business/economics/fraserofallanderinstitute/) and [Glasgow Caledonian University](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/), and data science expertise at [CivicDataLab](https://civicdatalab.in/) and [East Neuk Analytics](https://eastneukanalytics.com/). During this initial phase, the team will work in partnership with [Northern Alliance](https://northernalliance.scot/) and the Local Authorities they represent.

The objective within this initial phase is to work with stakeholders to identify the shared knowledge gap across local authorities, identify the most appropriate indicators and map the suitable data sources that can be used at the school catchment aggregation.
